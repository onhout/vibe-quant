"""Engine-vs-reference exact comparison: the third exactness gate (design §5).

``parity.compare_runs`` is the rule-level proof that the NT execution layer and
the no-NT reference simulator produce the *same* book: with one shared rule
implementation (``signal``/``sizing``/``ledger``/``ticks.check_release``), the
same tick prices and NT's own Decimal commission formula, both executors run the
identical functions on bitwise-equal inputs, so every downstream number is equal
-- never approximately equal.

The comparison is therefore EXACT (no tolerance, R30): a 1-step quantity or a
1-ulp fee is a DRIFT that fails ``scripts/agents/exactness_carry.py``, and
widening it needs a chief ruling. Rule *correctness* is proven by the contract
tests on hand-computed numbers, not here; this module only proves that no
execution path diverges from the rules.

Chief ruling R54: the comparison is structural and complete. Every field of every
``CarryFill``, ``Decision`` and ``FundingPayment`` is compared through
``dataclasses.fields()`` -- so a field added later is compared automatically and
no hand-written field list can silently drop one -- as are ``CarryRun.spec`` and
``CarryRun.final_steps`` and every ``CarryReport`` field (``summary``, ``daily``,
``weekly``, ``legs``, ``by_year``). ``CarryRun.engine`` is the ONE excluded
field: it differs by design (``"nt"`` vs ``"reference"``).

A value that is NaN in *both* runs counts as EQUAL (``math.isnan`` on both
sides), so a legitimate NaN never reads as a false drift; NaN against a real
number is still reported. Mismatch messages name the path, index and field, e.g.
``decisions[3].excluded: {'ETHUSDT': 'funding_hole'} != {'ETHUSDT': 'no_price'}``.
