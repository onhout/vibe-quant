"""Responsiveness and response-equality tests for the data router.

Two contracts are pinned here:

1. Blocking sync work in a data endpoint must not stall the API event loop:
   while a slow ``GET /api/data/coverage`` is in flight, an unrelated cheap
   request (``/health``) must still complete promptly.
2. ``GET /api/data/coverage`` output is unchanged after the batched archive
   read: same JSON for seeded archives, including the empty archive and the
   "symbol with no catalog bars" edges.
